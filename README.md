# Servy

App to Developing with Elixir/OTP course (The Pragmatic Studio)

## Run the server:

```
mix run --no-halt
```

-  If you want to override the default port value so that the web server runs on port 5000, for example. Here's how to do that:

```
elixir --erl "-servy port 5000" -S mix run --no-halt
```
